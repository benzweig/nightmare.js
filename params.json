That's why we made strangelove.js, so that you can bring their worst tween nightmares back to haunt them. \r\n\r\n### strangelove.js is the nuclear option.\r\nWhen all else fails, you can rely on our intelligent, targeted liking algorithms, optimized for maximum embarrassment.\r\n\r\n### Not sure if you want to push the button?\r\nDo it, ya sissy. The void calls to you. No regrets.\r\n\r\n### Possible dangers\r\nFacebook might not like it if you press the button too much, and we can't really control that. All we can do is encourage you to press it as often as possible, and let you know that we won't be liable for any consequences. You can still send us an angry email if you want, but we probably won't reply. Just know that we've read it, and probably laughed.\r\n\r\nLove,\r\nben & max\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
